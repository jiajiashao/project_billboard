To Do:
1. We need to fix the .gitignore file, only skipping bigger files, and uploading them to GD or online servers and pasting the links here in ReadME.
2. Writing a step by step guide here in ReadMe on how to install and run the programs, this includes what args to pass to a python script, and gives user an overview of what program does.
3. Creating requirements.txts and adding them to github repo, also including them in the guide on how to create the conda envs.
